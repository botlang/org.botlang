# String substitution

Botlang's string substitution feature let you create more realistic conversations by picking up certain
words from the user input. A string substitution is expressed by the dollar sign (`$`) within your
pattern.

Example:
```
+ "I $ you"
- "Perhaps in your fantasies we $ each other."
- "Do you wish to $ me?"
```
