# Wild-cards

Wild-cards in botlang are a powerful tool for writing more advanced matching pattern. A wild-card
is represented by the asterisk character `*`.

Example:

```
+ "*"
- "I'm not sure I understand you fully."
- "Please go on."
- "That is interesting. Please continue."
- "Tell me more about that."
- "Does talking about this bother you?"
- "I see."
```
